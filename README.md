Here are some projects I maintain

- [AI Runner](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner): A no install GUI that lets you run Stable Diffusion on your local hardware.
- [Chat AI](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/chatai): A no install GUI that lets you run Google Flan-T5 LLMs on your local hardware.
- [AI Handler](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/aihandler): The engine that powers both AI Runner and Chat AI
