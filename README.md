# Public portfolio

This is a constantly changing list of things I have worked on over the years. 

It is not a comprehensive list. Many of the projects I have worked on were under NDA and 
are only relevant to future potential employers. These will be listed in a separate private portfolio.

and then confidently tweets them out to the world where they can one day become the target of someone's outrage.
